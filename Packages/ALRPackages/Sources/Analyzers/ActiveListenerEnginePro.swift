// ActiveListenerEnginePro.swift
//
// Production-lean active-listening rule engine for a journaling app.
// Privacy-first: fully local, deterministic, no network, no user text logging.
//
// Highlights
// - Hundreds of rules generated from curated templates (no therapy clichés)
// - Reverse parsing: prioritizes last sentences/paragraph
// - Scoring: rule weight + recency position bonus + pattern specificity
// - Solo-voice mirror tone (no “we”, no advice)
// - Variant rotation + similarity guard to reduce repetition
// - Emotion-aware & Domain-aware fallbacks (1..8 emotions; optional domain scores)
// - Memory recalls trimmed to snippet length
// - Extensible: add templates without touching core logic
//
// Integration
// let reply = ActiveListenerEnginePro.shared.respond(
//     to: userText,
//     emotion: emotionID,                    // 1..8 (Joy..Mixed)
//     domains: [("Work", 0.62), ("Family", 0.18)], // optional, top-1 used if >= threshold
//     richEmotion: nil                       // optional 27-way code you may add later
// )
